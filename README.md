# PERT
Program Evaluation and Review Technique

You can estimate the time according to PERT by entering an optimistic, normal and pessimistic time to complete the task.

App idea from the book "The Clean Coder" (polish version "Mistrz czystego kodu") Robert C. Martin.

You can only add numbers in the input field. The program will not allow you to enter, for example, an optimistic performance value greater than for a normal or pessimistic assumption, similarly for other fields, i.e. a field with a pessimistic value must have the highest value.
The program allows tasks to be saved and the time is calculated for them. You can always delete the last task from the list or you can delete all tasks from the list.
